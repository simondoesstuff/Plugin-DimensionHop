# Plugin-DimensionHop

A kotlin-based minecraft plugin. Two new custom items.

## New Custom Items

1. **Bottle o' Nether**
  - Recipe:  1 Thick Potion + 1 Crying Obsidian

2. **End o' Bottle**
  - Recipe:  1 Thick Potion + 1 Dragon Head

#### Usage

Drinking the custom bottles allows you to teleport between dimensions. Think of it like as a pocket nether/end portal.
This is especially useful for manually linking nether portals because travelling in and out of the nether is often useful.
The end bottle is very valuable because it becomes the only (rare) alternative to escaping the end.

All bottles require you to stay still for 5s to use them.
